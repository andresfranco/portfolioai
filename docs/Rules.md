# Development Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the standard development practices to be followed across all modules of our project. These guidelines ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance.

## 1. API Design Principles

### 1.1 Endpoint Standardization
- Use RESTful patterns consistently across all endpoints
- Avoid duplicating endpoint functionality
- Use query parameters to control response detail level instead of creating multiple endpoints
- Follow plural nouns for resource collections (e.g., `/users` not `/user`)

### 1.2 Data Validation and Serialization
- Always use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Enable ORM mode for models that interact with database entities
- Define clear schemas with appropriate types and validations
- Avoid manual serialization whenever possible

### 1.3 Query Framework
- Use a consistent query builder pattern for database operations
- Standardize filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters
- Implement reusable query components for common operations
- Separate query logic from route handlers

## 2. Code Organization

### 2.1 Modular Structure
- Organize code by domain rather than technical function
- Group related functionality into logical modules
- Follow the principle of separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection to manage component relationships

### 2.2 Centralized Configuration
- Maintain centralized logging configuration
- Store environment-specific settings in a dedicated module
- Use environment variables for configuration that changes between environments
- Avoid hardcoded values and magic strings

## 3. Frontend Development

### 3.1 State Management
- Use React Context API or Redux for global state management
- Keep component state local when appropriate
- Implement clear data flow patterns
- Document state structure in each context provider

### 3.2 API Client Abstraction
- Create dedicated API client modules with consistent interfaces
- Implement request/response interceptors for common functionality
- Handle authentication and error cases consistently
- Group related API calls into service objects

### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
- Use proper component memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Optimize bundle size with appropriate imports
- Implement lazy loading for routes and heavy components

## 4. Error Handling and Debugging

### 4.1 Backend Error Handling
- Use exception handlers to standardize error responses
- Implement proper logging for all errors with appropriate context
- Return user-friendly error messages without exposing system details
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes consistently

### 4.2 Frontend Error Handling
- Implement Error Boundary components to catch and handle UI errors
- Provide user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Log client-side errors for monitoring
- Handle API errors consistently across the application

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Backend Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Test database interactions with proper fixtures and cleanup
- Aim for high code coverage, especially for critical paths

### 5.2 Frontend Testing
- Test components using React Testing Library
- Implement mock services for API dependencies
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test error states and edge cases

### 5.3 General Quality Practices
- Run linters and formatters before committing code
- Address all warnings and deprecated API usages
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Document public APIs and complex logic

## 6. Security Best Practices

### 6.1 Authentication and Authorization
- Implement proper token validation
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Apply principle of least privilege for API access
- Validate all user input

### 6.2 Data Protection
- Never expose sensitive data in logs or error messages
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security issues

Following these standards will ensure a consistent, maintainable, and secure codebase across all project modules.
